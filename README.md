## What is Nexton? 
Nexton is the new concept of an yield optimizer based on liquid staking that provides liquidity for staked assets. This Nexton provides a strong reason for coming TON to lazy whales who have a huge amount of TON, but don't activate on Defi protocols of TON. This enables nominators to obtain maximum staking profits without risking any chances. By enabling nominators to earn optimum staking rewards, and by guaranteeing LPs receive maximum 40% APY profits, it would work for the compelling reason for being coming into TON ecosystem. 

Simply put, LPs provide liquidity to enable nominators to execute a feature for maximizing staking rewards while LPs receive incentives, on the other side, nominators are going to earn optimum rewards while they retaining NFT during lock-up period. Under the hood, this protocol is connected to TON nominator pool. It means all of provided liqudity and requested amount of staking assets are staked, then each stakeholder could optimized profits. Furthermore, it would be connected to existing staking-related protocols as long as we could make synergy with them.
