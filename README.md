## What is Nexton? 
Nexton is a yield optimizer based on liquid staking that offers liquidity for staked assets. It appeals to large TON holders who are not active in Defi protocols by providing them with a secure way to earn maximum staking profits. Additionally, it guarantees LPs a maximum 40% APY, making it an attractive option for entering the TON ecosystem.

Simply put, LPs provide liquidity to enable nominators to execute a feature for maximizing staking rewards while LPs receive incentives, on the other side, nominators are going to earn optimum rewards while they retaining NFT during lock-up period. Under the hood, this protocol is connected to TON nominator pool. It means all of provided liqudity and requested amount of staking assets are staked, then each stakeholder could optimized profits. Furthermore, it would be connected to existing staking-related protocols as long as we could make synergy with them.
